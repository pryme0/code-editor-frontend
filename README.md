# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# Environment variables

You'll need the api key for Judge0 api (I am using this api to compile the code)

The Api is running on port 9000 , you'll need to add  the hosted api route as well (or use the one in the env.example file).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Note that you'll need to have started your api before hand

You'll need to create an account and login in order to access the editor interface.

Accounts can be created on the signUp page.
